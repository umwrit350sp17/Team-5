# Team 5: Document Outline 

This file contains the analysis of the audience for the document as well as the general outline of the project. 

## Audience Profile
Sara Jones is beginning her higher education at Boston University in the fall, and she dreams of becoming a photographer after college. She is currently enrolled in a 100 level photography class that requires all students to download sufficient photo editing software, in order to further enhance their techniques and learning ability. The students are required to complete 3 minor assignments weekly, which makes the software necessary for students. Due to increasing prices in photo editing software, Gimp, is a free and professional software used by photographers in the industry. The webiste allows for image editing, touch-ups and manipulation.
