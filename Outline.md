# Team 5: Document Outline 

This file contains the analysis of the audience for the document as well as the general outline of the project for our team.

## Audience Profile
Sara Jones is beginning higher education this upcoming fall at Boston University, and she dreams of becoming a photographer after college. Due to outrageous out of state tuition costs and other scholastic expenses, Sara fears that her parents won't be able to afford the various and extremely expensive outside costs that photography majors often have to face. She is currently enrolled in a 100 level photography class that requires all students to download sufficient photo editing software, in order to further enhance their techniques and learning ability. The students are required to complete 3 minor assignments weekly, which makes the software necessary for students. Due to increasing prices in photo editing software, Gimp, is a free and professional software used by photographers in the industry. The webiste allows for image editing, touch-ups and manipulation. Gimp offers many features that are available for many operating systems across the board, although there are some limitations to the site as well. According to Rob Cubbon, some of the disadvantages include the inability to select multiple layers, inability to apply the same text styles to numerous text layers, inability to add effects to editable text, no way to export images optimised for the web, difficulty arranging layers, and poor support for vectors.

## Project Outline
- We plan on using step by step detailed instructions 
- Our multimedia element will most likely include screenshots, because we believe that those will be the most effective for our target publics
- There aren't any external links at this point that we feel the need to include other than the Gimp website. https://www.gimp.org/ 

Title: A student guide to success in photoediting 
 
 1. Introduction
 
 In order to attract our specific demographic and make Gimp appeal to photography majors, we need to insisit on how necessary this software is. We need to provide solid information about why this software stands out. It's crucial that we hone in on the benefits that seperate this program from others, which are that it's cost-effective, professional, and is readily downloadble for various operating systems. 
 
 2. Instructions 
 
 We want to limit our instructions and make our step by step guide concise, yet detailed. 
 
 The multimedia content will include before and after photos to show the details this software has to offer. We will also be including a video example that shows the various ways in which you can edit and how to do so.
