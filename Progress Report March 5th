Progress Report:

Accomplishments:
  1. Decided we wanted to use GroupMe as new form of communication instead of Slack
  2. Decided the topic for our project (GIMP)
  3. Worked on repository as a team
  4. Communicated with all group members to determine future goals for our project
  
  
Concerns:
  We are trying to familiarize ourselves with GitHub, and see that as our biggest struggle thus far as well as getting a full understanding of what the final deliverable will need to look like.
