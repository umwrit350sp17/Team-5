   Conflict Resolution:
    If there is a conflict amongst group members, we will try our best to work it out within our team. If the issue can not seem to be resolved, we will contact the instructor. We plan on all working our best to meet the needs of this project and feel as if we will be able to handle any conflicts we may experience ourselves.
    
    
    Missed Deadlines:
     We plan on reminding one another about upcoming deadlines so we won't miss anything. If a team member is slacking on work, other group members may try and make up for it. If it is an issue, the instructor may need to be contacted. We all plan on being responsible and making enough time to ensure we meet all deadline requirements. We will all set personal deadlines and team deadlines as well.
     
    Unacceptable Work:
      If a team member submits work that other team members feel could use improvement, other team members should reach out and offer examples on what they can fix to make it even better. We understand we are a team and will offer constructive criticism in order to make sure we submit the best project we can.
